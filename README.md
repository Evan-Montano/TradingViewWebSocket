# TradingView Real-Time Candlestick Listener

This project connects to [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com)'s real-time chart WebSocket endpoint, subscribes to market data, and logs candlestick updates (OHLCV) for downstream processing. It's designed to be extensible, forming the foundation for future prediction and analysis layersâ€”such as machine learning models for chart-based forecasting.

## Features

* Connects to TradingView's WebSocket feed
* Authenticates and subscribes to a specified chart symbol
* Parses and logs candlestick data in real-time (timestamp, OHLC, volume)
* Designed with modularity in mind to support future automation or AI features
* Works with any NASDAQ symbol

## Requirements

* .NET 6 SDK or newer
* Internet connection

## Usage

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Evan-Montano/TradingViewWebSocket.git
   cd TradingViewWebSocket
   ```

2. **Configure symbol & channel settings**
   Edit `Application.cs` to set:

   ```csharp
   string symbol = "NVDA"; // Example TradingView NASDAQ symbol
   string resolution = "1";           // 1-minute candles
   ```

3. **Build and run**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Observe logs**
   Candlestick data will be printed or persisted based on your current `CandlestickUpdateProcessor` implementation.
